# Spring IOC Container 
* The Spring IoC container is at the core of the Spring Framework.

#### Inversion of Control (IoC) principle.
* IoC is also known as dependency injection (DI). 
* The container will create the objects, wire them together, configure them, and manage their complete life cycle from creation till destruction. 
* The Spring container uses dependency injection (DI) to manage the components that make up an application.

* The container then injects those dependencies when it creates the bean. 


* This process is fundamentally the inverse, hence the name Inversion of Control (IoC), of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies by using direct construction of classes, or a mechanism such as the Service Locator pattern.
